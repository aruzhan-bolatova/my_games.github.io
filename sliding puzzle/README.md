# Sliding Puzzles in Processing (Python) 

Sliding Puzzles is a classic video game concept that challenges players to rearrange a set of puzzle pieces within a bordered window or canvas. The objective is to manipulate the pieces, typically squares or tiles, by sliding them into an empty space in order to reconstruct a complete image or pattern.
