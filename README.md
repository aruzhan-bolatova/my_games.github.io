# Snake in Processing (Python) 

Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in 1976 and the ease of implementing Snake has led to many versions for many platforms. The player uses the arrow keys to control an object on a bordered window (canvas). As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. The snake starts with a specific length, so there is a moving tail with a fixed number of units away from the head. When the snake “eats” an item (food) that was randomly placed on the board, the snake grows by one unit, and a new food item is randomly positioned on the board as the snake keeps moving.

The player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake grow one unit longer, so controlling the snake is progressively more difficult. The player loses when the snake runs into the board boundaries or itself. Also, the game ends when the screen is completely filled with snake elements, i.e. the snake is not able to move anymore.
