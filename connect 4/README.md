# Connect 4 in Python3

Connect 4 is a simple board game for multiple players and can be played here: https://www.cbc.ca/kids/games/play/connect-4

Connect 4 is typically a two player game and is played on a two-dimensional board. The players take turns by dropping their checker into a column of the board. The checkers fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The first player who gets 4 checkers in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally - wins the game.

The Connect 4 game is implemented in Python3, giving practice in working with lists, decision structures, loops, functions, and other concepts. Additionally, it is a good exercise in decomposing larger problems into smaller and more manageable parts.
